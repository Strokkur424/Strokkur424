## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It is me, Strokkur24!
Fancy seeing you here. It seems to me that you âœ¨ _somehow_ âœ¨ found a way to my GitHub!
Let me tell you something about me:

- My main programming languages are:
  - Java <!-- ![Java](https://banner2.cleanpng.com/20180517/zve/kisspng-java-programmer-computer-programming-logo-5afe2f1dcf9897.0745314915266076458503.jpg) -->
  - C# <!-- ![C#](https://banner2.cleanpng.com/20180517/zve/kisspng-java-programmer-computer-programming-logo-5afe2f1dcf9897.0745314915266076458503.jpg) -->
  
  - ...and as of late C++, and even a bit of C! 

- Eventhough most of my repositories are private, I do have some bigger projects, which due to closed-source bs I can not share. But beware! I will put up some bangers soon!

If you'd like to get in contact with me consider sending me a message on [Discord (Click to view my profile)](https://discord.com/users/813141164281692170)

## About my ethics
I do plugin and mod developement for fun. I am not actively making money off of it. I've been coding for almost 5 years now and I've loved every second of it.
This means that I am by no means a professional coder and you should not expect me to be able to create the next WorldEdit any time soon ðŸš’
