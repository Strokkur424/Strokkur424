### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It is me, Strokkur24!
Fancy seeing you here. It seems to me that you âœ¨ _somehow_ âœ¨ found a way to my GitHub!
Let me tell you something about me:

- My main programming languages are:
  - ![Java](https://banner2.cleanpng.com/20180517/zve/kisspng-java-programmer-computer-programming-logo-5afe2f1dcf9897.0745314915266076458503.jpg) Java
  - ![C#](https://banner2.cleanpng.com/20180517/zve/kisspng-java-programmer-computer-programming-logo-5afe2f1dcf9897.0745314915266076458503.jpg) C#

- Eventhough most of my repositories are private, I've worked on some bigger projects. One work-in-progress project of mine is [AstiaMC](https://github.com/AstiaMC), a 1.8 factions-type Minecraft server.

If you'd like to get in contact with me consider sending me a message on [Discord (Click to view my profile)](https://discord.com/users/813141164281692170)

### I accept plugin requests!
If you want a plugin custom coded and are willing to pay me money (between 10â‚¬ - 100â‚¬ depending on the project size), I can develop a Minecraft plugin in any version for you!

I accept only PayPal ![PayPal](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Paypal_2014_logo.png)

...or if you have a obfuscated plugin and don't have the source code for it and would like me to deobfuscate it for you, you can ask me as well!
Deobfuscating a compiled plugin would be around 25â‚¬. 

### Another notice
I do plugin developement for fun. I am not actively making money off of it. I've been coding for almost 5 years now and I've loved every second of it.
This means that I am by no means a professional coder and you should not expect me to be able to create the next WorldEdit any time soon ðŸš’
