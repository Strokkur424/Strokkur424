## Commissions are now open ðŸš€
After almost 6 years of development in public and private projects, I have decided to open commissions for Minecraft Paper plugins!

### What do I do?
- Plugin refactoring (message configurations, logic cleanup, Maven/Groovy Gradle -> Kotlin Gradle conversion).
- Converting Bukkit commands to Brigadier commands.
- Adding and fixing features in existing plugins.

### What are my experiences?
- As an active part of the PaperMC community, I have near perfect knowledge of the Paper API.
- One of my biggest contributions is the addition of the Brigadier docs to PaperMC: https://docs.papermc.io/paper/dev/command-api/basics/introduction.
- Very knowledgable with [Adventure](https://docs.advntr.dev).

### Terms
- I will not be accepting any gianormous projects or long-term dev positions. I only want to do one-time work.
- The plugin needs to use Paper API on version 1.21.1 or higher.
- A plugin has to exist, which I will extend. I do not want to create plugins from scratch.
- You should have a repository on GitHub.
- Payment will be discussed in advance, but you only have to pay once I am finished!
- **I will only do Java plugins, no Kotlin!**

### Contact
You can contact me via Discord: [`@strokkur24`](https://discord.com/users/813141164281692170). All payment goes through PayPal.
