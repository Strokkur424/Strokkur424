## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It is me, Strokkur24!
Fancy seeing you here. It seems to me that you âœ¨ _somehow_ âœ¨ found a way to my GitHub!
Let me tell you something about me:

- My main programming languages are:
  - Java <!-- ![Java](https://banner2.cleanpng.com/20180517/zve/kisspng-java-programmer-computer-programming-logo-5afe2f1dcf9897.0745314915266076458503.jpg) -->
  - C# <!-- ![C#](https://banner2.cleanpng.com/20180517/zve/kisspng-java-programmer-computer-programming-logo-5afe2f1dcf9897.0745314915266076458503.jpg) -->
  
  - ...and as of late C++ 

- Eventhough most of my repositories are private, I've worked on some bigger projects. Some work-in-progress projects of mine are [AstiaMC](https://discord.gg/astiamc), a 1.8 factions-type Minecraft server and [MineLimit](https://discord.gg/minelimit), a 1.20 server network where I active develop for.

If you'd like to get in contact with me consider sending me a message on [Discord (Click to view my profile)](https://discord.com/users/813141164281692170)

## Another notice
I do plugin and mod developement for fun. I am not actively making money off of it. I've been coding for almost 5 years now and I've loved every second of it.
This means that I am by no means a professional coder and you should not expect me to be able to create the next WorldEdit any time soon ðŸš’
